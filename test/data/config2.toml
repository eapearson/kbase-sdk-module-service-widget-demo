[ui]
# in prod the ui host is narrative.kbase.us, but in all others it
# is X.kbase.us, where X is ci, next, appdev, narrative-dev
#  defaults:
# the ui origin is the base url for which to create links back to the ui
# This is used when a redirection back to a ui is needed for error reporting
# during oauth flow.
# KBASE_ENDPOINT is like https://ci.kbase.us/services/
# splitting on / gives ['https:', '', 'ci.kbase.us', 'services', '']
# we are interested in the hostname.
