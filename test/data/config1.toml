# the ui origin is the base url for which to create links back to the ui
# This is used when a redirection back to a ui is needed for error reporting
# during oauth flow.
# KBASE_ENDPOINT is like https://ci.kbase.us/services/
# splitting on / gives ['https:', '', 'ci.kbase.us', 'services', '']
# we are interested in the hostname.
