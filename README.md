## Installation

This service is not directly installable as such. It is a REST-based web service and must be built and run within a compatible deployment environment.

One could say that "installation" consists of building a Docker image and hosting it somewhere. In practice, this is conducted at GitHub, with a build conducted by [GitHub Actions](docs/operation/deployment.md#github-actions) and hosted at the [GitHub Container Repository (GHCR)](https://ghcr.io), also known as [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/features/packages).

## API

The [API docs](docs/api/index.md) are generated automatically, and are [available in the codebase](docs/api/index.md) as well as from a live instance of the service at the `/docs` endpoint.
