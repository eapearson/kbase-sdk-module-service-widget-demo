        You see, a widget can just be html, css, and Javascript, without anything fancy.
    </p>

    <div id="root"></div>
    <script>
        const p = document.createElement('p');
        p.innerText = 'As I was saying, just Javascript, html, css.';
        document.getElementById('root').appendChild(p);
    </script>
